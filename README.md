#WorldDownloader 1.8d for Minecraft 1.8 using MCP 9.10

A [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) mod that downloads a copy of a world on a multiplayer server for personal singleplayer use.  This is a continuation of [dslake's original version](https://github.com/dslake/WorldDownloader), updated to 1.8 and beyond.

MCP is used for decompilation and recompilation.  Download it from [here](http://www.modcoderpack.com/website/releases).

You can also try [uyjulian's liteloader version](https://github.com/uyjulian/WorldDownloader/) ([pre-1.8 builds](https://github.com/uyjulian/LitemodWDL)), which is based off of this version.
