#WorldDownloader 1.8.9a (**beta**) for Minecraft 1.8.9 using [MCP 9.18-beta](https://twitter.com/SeargeDP/status/671124338192556032) with broken SRG mappings

A minecraft mod that downloads a copy of a world on a multiplayer server for personal singleplayer use.  This is a fork of [@dslake's original version](https://github.com/dslake/WorldDownloader), updated to 1.8.9.

MCP is used for decompilation and recompilation.  Download it from [here](http://www.modcoderpack.com/website/releases).

You can also try [@uyjulian's liteloader version](https://github.com/uyjulian/LiteModWDL/) (which is based off of this one).

Note: SRG mappings are **NOT** yet available for 1.8.9.  However, this is fine for most things, but this DOES mean that GameSettings and a few other classes have messy values.  This version uses MCP for 1.8.8 with a 1.8.9 jar; beware.  Hopefully 1.8.9 SRG mappings will come out soon.
