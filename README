WorldDownloader for Minecraft 1.3.1
THIS IS NOT THE FINAL RELEASE - THERE ARE STILL BUGS IN THIS VERSION

I use MCP 7.0a http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases  for decompiling,
deobfuscation, recompiling, and reobfuscation. Just install it, follow it's Readme file,
put my files in the src/minecraft/net/minecraft/src folder and use the batch or sh scripts.
