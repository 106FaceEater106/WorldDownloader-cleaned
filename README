WorldDownloader v2 for Minecraft 1.3.2 - INCOMPLETE RELEASE

I used MCP 7.2 http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases#MCP_7.x
for deobfuscation, recompiling, and reobfuscation. Just install it, follow it's Readme file,

Copy src files into src/minecraft/net/minecraft/src folder and use the batch or sh scripts.

THIS IS NOT THE FINAL RELEASE - THERE ARE STILL BUGS IN THIS VERSION
