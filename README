I used MCP 7.19 for Minecraft 1.4.2 for deobfuscation, recompiling, and reobfuscation. 
Just download MCP, install it and follow the instructions here:
http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases#MCP_7.x

Copy src files into src/minecraft/net/minecraft/src folder and use the batch or sh scripts.
