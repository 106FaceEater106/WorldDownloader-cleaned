BUG TRACKER CAN BE FOUND HERE:
https://github.com/dslake/WorldDownloader/issues?state=open

TODO:
* TileTicks for repeaters
* Offers from villagers
* Record Players don't do anything. => Create empty TileEntityRecordPlayer ???
* Save new position when sleeping

OTHER KNOWN BUGS:
* Stopping download and quickly opening the cloned world => not all chunks are saved (threaded IO problem?)


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS    
* "Get Seed from Server" button (will require op privilege on server)
* Backup world functionality when overwriting a save
